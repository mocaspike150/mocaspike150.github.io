<div>This page contains vital statistics for Spike 150 Virtual Relay; including weekly club and individual
leaderboards.  The live leaderboards are updated hourly based on data
obtained through the fitness app Strava.  While some of the clubs have
more than 100 members, due to the limitations of Strava, we are only able to
pull live data for 100 members from each club.  At the end of the week the
statistics will be updated based on a club's actual membership and their
distance will be averaged on the weekly scorecard accordingly. </div>
