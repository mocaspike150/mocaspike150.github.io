  Emblematic of the Chinese Exclusion Act experience, Shuck Wing Chin emigrated from a small village on the southern coast of Guangdong Province in China to the U.S. in 1935 in order to support his family. While already employed as a grocery store clerk, he recognized he could make a better living as a laborer in America as many of his family members had done already; including his own father. When his father passed away while still living in the States, the twenty-four-year-old Chin immigrated to the U.S. as a “paper son” of his Uncle Chin Ton, a businessman in Tucson, Arizona. He spent his first thirty-three days in America in detention at Angel Island as he waited for his falsified paperwork to be approved. Chin worked at Jim Lee Laundry and an American Chinese restaurant in New York’s Chinatown. He was later drafted into the Air Force during World War II. After leaving the military he moved back to New York’s Chinatown and began working as a cook while living at 111 Mott Street. Over the years, Chin became estranged from his family back home and stopped sending remittances and letters, never returning to China. After he passed away in 1987 at the age of seventy-six, the contents of his apartment at 111 Mott Street were thrown away and salvaged by MOCA, including several letters.

  这是一则排华法案时期的典型案列。甄灼荣为了养活家庭，于1935年从中国广东南部沿海的一个小村庄移民到美国。当时他在家乡已经是一个杂货店店员，但他相信在美国当一名工人能够过上更好的生活，就像他许多家庭成员已经做过的那样，包括他的父亲。当他父亲在美国去世时，24岁的甄灼荣作为他叔叔Chin Ton的“纸儿子”移民到了美国，他的叔叔是一名在亚利桑那州图森市经商的商人。为了等待他伪造的“纸儿子”文书得到批准，他不得不先在天使岛被监禁了33天。进入美国后，甄灼荣先在纽约唐人街的吉姆李洗衣房（Jim Lee Laundry）和一家美国中餐馆工作，之后在二战期间他被应征加入空军。退伍后，他回到纽约中国城勿街111号，并成为了一名厨师。多年以后，甄灼荣和在国内的家人变得疏远，不再寄送汇款和信件，也没有再回到中国。1987年，这位76岁的老人去世后，他在勿街111号公寓的遗物被丢弃，包括一些信件，但所幸被MOCA挽救。
